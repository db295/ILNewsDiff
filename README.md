A Twitter bot that keeps track of changes made in Israeli news websites.

Currently tracking:

* [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.co.il/)
* [Israel Hayom](https://Israelhayom.co.il/)
* [Walla](https://www.walla.co.il/)

## How does it work?

Once a minute the code queries news feeds and compares them to a previous state saved in a local SQLite DB.

If an _interesting_ change is found, a tweet is published with the diff.

The first tweet of a diff is always the article itself as a link, and all the subsequent changes are chained by order.

### What is _interesting_?

A change that

* Has happened and is not there because of a delay in the RSS feed. The code queries the article's page to look for the change.
* Is not comprised of only whitespace or punctuation.
* Has a difference of more than one letter (Though adding/removing a question mark '?' is interesting)

## Installation

* The [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) binary needs to be installed, and the path updated in the run_diff.sh file.
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

[Twitter keys](https://dev.twitter.com/) are needed.
